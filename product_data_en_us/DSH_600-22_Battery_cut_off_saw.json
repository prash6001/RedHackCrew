  "content": "DSH 600-22 Battery cut off saw Battery powered cut off saw for concrete, metal and masonry (Nuron battery platform) ### Categories: Home > Products > Power tools > Concrete saws- - - ### FEATURES:Features Battery-powered concrete saw for heavy-duty tasks – DSH 600-22 gets the same work done as a 60cc gas cut off saw, but without the fumes, noise, extra maintenance or fuel mix issues Longer trigger time – cuts up to 30% more than a full tank of gas with four B 22-255 Nuron batteries and 12 SPX univ. A cordless-optimized blades Lower running costs – no fuel to buy or mix; less maintenance, and up to double the lifespan of a gas saw thanks to a brushless electric motor Improved safety features – fume-free, quieter, lower-vibration cutting, and a fast-acting blade brake Better maneuverability – weighing just 19.6 lbs (or 26.5 lbs including two B 22-170 batteries and a 12” blade), this cut-off saw is engineered for comfortable handling in any orientation Applications Cutting concrete and masonry – such as making new openings or trimming blocks to size (max. cutting depth 4-3/4 with 12” blades) Paving – cutting curbstones, pavers and asphalt Metalwork – cutting metal deck, rebar, steel sheet, metal track, and pipes Cutting indoors – battery-powered cut-off saws are quieter and fume-free Virtually dust-free cutting – OSHA 1926.1153 Table-1 compliance for silica dust control when used with a compatible water supply (available separately) ### TECHNICAL DATA: Base materials: All types of concrete and brick, All types of masonry (hollow brick, limestone, etc), Asphalt, Steel, Masonry Dimensions (LxWxH): 26 x 11.4 x 13.8 in Protection class: IEC Battery operated Technical Data | Base materials | All types of concrete and brick, All types of masonry (hollow brick, limestone, etc), Asphalt, Steel, Masonry | Dimensions (LxWxH) | 26 x 11.4 x 13.8 in | Protection class | IEC Battery operated | Work environment | Interior and Exterior | Arbor Size | Option 1 : 1 in; Option 2: 20 mm | A-weighted emission sound power level | 108 dB (A) | 1 | According to the applicable product standard (see the Operating Instruction for more details) ### ITEMS- 3782604 - DSH 600-22 CUT OFF SAW KIT - Package Size 1 pc Package Contents: - 1x DSH 600-22 Hand-held battery cut-off saw - 1x D60 Flange kit - 2x C 8-22 110-127V Battery charger - 2x B 22-255 Li-ion Battery pack",
