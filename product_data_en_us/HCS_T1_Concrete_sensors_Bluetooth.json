  "content": "HCS T1 Concrete sensors (Bluetooth®) Concrete maturity sensors for monitoring temperature and strength using Bluetooth® on-site data collection ### Categories: Home > Products > Measuring tools & scanners > Concrete scanners and sensors- - - ### FEATURES:Features More efficient scheduling – concrete maturity sensors put live curing data at your fingertips to better plan the day’s work Avoid concrete testing delays – shave up to 1-2 days off every pour cycle by switching to live curing data Optimize rental costs – rent equipment only once your concrete is strong enough Easy to use – simply attach the concrete sensors to rebar using cable ties before you pour, and see the results from anywhere using mobile Apps or desktop software Applications Concrete strength monitoring – know immediately when formwork stripping can take place, and when rental equipment is needed Concrete temperature measurement – know when to mitigate against extreme temperatures Bluetooth®-based sensors are ideal for checking concrete maturity while you’re on-site and in range of the sensor. If your project will have sensors distributed over a large area or you need continuous monitoring with cloud-based access to the information from anywhere, we recommend HCS T2 long-range concrete sensors For monitoring strength, a laboratory calibration service may be required. Contact your Hilti sales representative for further information ### TECHNICAL DATA: Monitoring: Strength and temperature Data collection: Bluetooth Data collection frequency: Strength and temperature: every 15 minutes for the first 60 days Technical Data | Monitoring | Strength and temperature | Data collection | Bluetooth | Data collection frequency | Strength and temperature: every 15 minutes for the first 60 days | Standards | Complies with ASTM C1074 | Wireless signal range (up to) | 100 ft | Temperature - range | -40 °F - 185 °F ### ITEMS- 2300656 - Concrete sensor HCS T1-B15 - Package Size 1 pc - 2300654 - Concrete sensor HCS T1-B3 - Package Size 1 pc - 2300655 - Concrete sensor HCS T1-B8 - Package Size 1 pc - 2300653 - Concrete sensor HCS T1 - Package Size 1 pc",
