Construction Phase: [Foundation/Structure/Finishing - if determinable]
2. STRUCTURAL DIMENSIONS
Overall Building Dimensions: Length × Width × Height
Floor-to-Floor Height:
Ceiling Height:
Foundation Depth: [if visible]
Total Site Area: [if shown]
3. WALL SPECIFICATIONS
Exterior Wall Thickness: [in inches/mm]
Interior Wall Thickness: [partition walls]
Load-bearing Wall Locations: [describe locations]

Insulation Details: [if shown]
4. STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS
Column Sizes: [dimensions and locations]
Beam Specifications: [sizes and spans]
Slab Thickness: [floor/roof slabs]
Reinforcement Details: [rebar specifications if visible]
Structural Material Type: [RCC/Steel/Composite]
5. FOUNDATION & GROUND CONDITIONS
Foundation Type: [Strip/Pad/Raft/Pile - if shown]
Foundation Dimensions:
Soil Type: [if indicated in notes/legend]
Ground Level Information:
Basement Details: [if applicable]
6. OPENINGS & PENETRATIONS

Plumbing Systems: [pipe runs, fixture locations]
Service Penetrations: [wall/floor penetrations needed]
8. CONSTRUCTION METHODOLOGY INDICATORS
Access Points: [crane positions, material delivery areas]
Temporary Structures: [scaffolding requirements]
Construction Sequence: [if determinable from drawings]
Special Construction Notes: [any specific requirements]
9. MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS
Concrete Grade: [if specified]
Steel Grade: [if specified]
Masonry Type: [brick/block specifications]
Finishing Materials: [if indicated]
10. HILTI TOOL APPLICATION AREAS
Based on the analysis above, identify specific construction activities that would require Hilti tools:
Drilling Applications: [concrete/masonry/steel drilling requirements]
Anchoring Needs: [structural anchoring, facade fixing]
Cutting Requirements: [material types and thicknesses to cut]
Demolition Areas: [selective demolition needs]
Installation Work: [mechanical/electrical installations]
Measurement & Layout: [surveying and marking requirements]
11. CRITICAL MEASUREMENTS & TOLERANCES
Precise Dimensions: [all critical measurements found]
Tolerance Requirements: [if specified]
Reference Points: [benchmarks, grid lines]
Output Format Requirements
Be Specific: Provide exact measurements with units
Flag Uncertainties: If any detail is unclear, note "Not clearly visible" or "Requires clarification"
Cross-Reference: Note drawing scale and reference any legend/notes
Prioritize: Highlight the most critical dimensions and specifications
Context: Explain how each detail relates to potential tool requirements
Additional Notes
If text in the blueprint is too small to read clearly, mention this limitation
If multiple drawing sheets are shown, analyze each separately
Note any discrepancies between different views (plan/section/elevation)
Identify any missing information that would be crucial for tool selection
Please analyze the uploaded blueprint image following this comprehensive framework."
